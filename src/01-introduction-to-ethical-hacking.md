## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Define ethical hacking and its importance
- Understand the different types of hackers
- Learn about hacking methodologies
- Identify legal implications of ethical hacking
- Understand security policies and frameworks

## What is Ethical Hacking?

Ethical hacking is the practice of intentionally penetrating networks and/or computer systems to find security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious hackers.

### Key Characteristics

- **Permission:** Always performed with explicit permission
- **Documentation:** All activities are documented
- **Remediation:** Focus on fixing identified vulnerabilities
- **Legal compliance:** Conducted within legal boundaries

## Types of Hackers

### White Hat Hackers

- Ethical hackers who use their skills for defensive purposes
- Work to improve security
- Follow legal and ethical guidelines

### Black Hat Hackers

- Malicious hackers who exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain
- Engage in illegal activities
- Cause damage to systems and data

### Gray Hat Hackers

- Fall between white and black hat categories
- May violate laws but without malicious intent
- Often expose vulnerabilities publicly

## Hacking Methodology

### Phases of Ethical Hacking

1. **Reconnaissance** - Information gathering
2. **Scanning** - Network and port scanning
3. **Gaining Access** - Exploiting vulnerabilities
4. **Maintaining Access** - Establishing persistence
5. **Covering Tracks** - Removing evidence

## Legal Considerations

### Important Legal Frameworks

- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)** - US federal law
- **DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act)**
- **FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act)**
- **SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)**
- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**

### Penetration Testing Agreement

Always ensure you have:

- Written permission from the system owner
- Clear scope definition
- Timeline and methodology agreement
- Legal liability clauses

## Security Frameworks

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework

- **Identify:** Asset management, risk assessment
- **Protect:** Access control, data security
- **Detect:** Anomaly detection, monitoring
- **Respond:** Incident response, communications
- **Recover:** Recovery planning, improvements

### ISO 27001

- International standard for information security management
- Risk-based approach to security
- Continuous improvement process

## Review Questions

1. What is the primary difference between ethical hacking and malicious hacking?
2. List the five phases of ethical hacking methodology.
3. What legal document should always be obtained before conducting a penetration test?
4. Name three types of hackers and their characteristics.
5. What are the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework?

## Key Takeaways

- Ethical hacking is essential for proactive security
- Always obtain proper authorization before testing
- Follow established methodologies and frameworks
- Document all findings and provide remediation guidance
- Stay current with legal and regulatory requirements
