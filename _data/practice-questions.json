      "TCP Connect scan (-sT)",
      "TCP SYN scan (-sS)",
      "UDP scan (-sU)",
      "TCP FIN scan (-sF)"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "TCP FIN scan (-sF) is considered more stealthy as it sends FIN packets which are less likely to be logged by firewalls and IDS systems."

      "-T4 (Aggressive)",

    "options": [
      "Performs a TCP SYN scan",

      "Performs service version detection",
      "Enables verbose output"

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The -sn option (ping scan) skips the port scan phase and only performs host discovery to determine which hosts are online."
